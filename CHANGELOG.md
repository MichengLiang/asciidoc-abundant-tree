This project uses semantic versioning after `0.1.0`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-26

Initial public release.

### Added

- Single-file AsciiDoc parsing through `parseAbundantTree`.
- Source-aware `AbundantDocument` model for sections, paragraphs, listings, tables, metadata, targets, anchors, and xrefs.
- Target catalog for sections, blocks, listings, tables, inline anchors, and block anchors.
- Xref occurrence records with raw target text, labels, source spans, containing section, scope, target kind, and official Asciidoctor binding data.
- Pretty tree output through `formatAbundantTree`.
- JSON-safe serialization through `serializeAbundantTreeToJson`.
- CLI entry point `asciidoc-abundant-tree`.
- Apache-2.0 license, GitHub Actions CI, and npm package metadata.

### Known Boundaries

- The parser reads one source file at a time.
- Include graphs and interdocument target validation are outside the current package boundary.
- The output is an analysis-oriented tree, not a full AsciiDoc CST or replacement for Asciidoctor.
